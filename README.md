# About me

With expertise in data engineering, data science, and a passion with AI, I am eager to learn skills to leverage data-driven insights to solve complex problems and drive business growth. With a strong background in building automation pipelines, and developing machine learning models, I am looking forward to working with big data and applying fancy techniques to solve real-world problems.
